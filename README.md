## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates **Enterprise-style Active Directory automation** using PowerShell, designed for **senior IT engineers**.  

It simulates real-world tasks that a 3rd-line IT support engineer would handle, including:  

- ‚úÖ Bulk user onboarding via CSV  
- ‚úÖ Active Directory group assignments  
- ‚úÖ Home folder provisioning  
- ‚úÖ Secure password generation (demo-only)  
- ‚úÖ Logging and error handling  
- ‚úÖ Mock Azure Key Vault integration for secret management  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è *Demo only ‚Äî no real domain or server required*

This is a **safe, fully offline demonstration** suitable for showcasing technical skills to recruiters and hiring managers.

## ‚ö° Demo Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single User (Basic Demo)
```powershell
.\create_user_basic_demo.ps1 -FirstName "Alice" -LastName "Johnson"
```
- Generates a **demo user** in the fake domain `demo.local`  
- Generates a **secure random password**  
- Simulates Azure Key Vault secret retrieval  
- Fully offline ‚Äî no real AD required  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bulk Users (CSV-Driven Demo)
```powershell
.\create_users_csv_demo.ps1 -CsvPath ".\users.csv"
```
- Reads `users.csv` with fields:  
  `FirstName,LastName,Department,Groups`  
- Creates multiple demo users  
- Simulates group assignments & home folder creation  
- Logs all actions in `onboarding_run_log_demo.csv`  
- Includes **demo Azure Key Vault secret retrieval**  

**Example `users.csv`:**
```csv
FirstName,LastName,Department,Groups
John,Doe,IT,"IT-Dept;VPN-Users"
Sara,Miller,HR,"HR-Dept"
Alice,Johnson,IT,"IT-Dept;VPN-Users"
```
